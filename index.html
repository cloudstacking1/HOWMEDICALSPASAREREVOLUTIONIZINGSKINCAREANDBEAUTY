                <div id="faq3" class="faq-content">A: Results vary depending on the treatment, but many people see noticeable improvements immediately following their procedure. For example, you may notice smoother skin or reduced wrinkles within a few days after Botox treatment. With laser or body contouring treatments, results typically develop over several weeks as your body works to eliminate fat or regenerate skin cells.</div>
